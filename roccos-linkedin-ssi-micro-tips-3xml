        <h2>Reply to DMs Politely (Even the Weird Ones)</h2>
        <p>Answer messages, even when they're irrelevant. You never know where a conversation leads.</p>
        <p>Someone reaches out about something random? Reply anyway. Keep it brief and polite. "Thanks for reaching out, not quite what I'm looking for right now, but I appreciate it." Done. You've kept the door open without committing to anything.</p>
        <p>Photographers get DMs from random brands. Teachers get messages from former students years later. One boring DM might lead to a referral, a collaboration, or just good karma. Be accessible. It costs you nothing.</p>

        <h2>Show, Don't Just Tell</h2>
        <p>Replace buzzwords with actual stories. Nobody believes "team player" without proof.</p>
        <p>Instead of saying you're a strong communicator, describe how you explained a complex budget to non-finance stakeholders. Instead of "problem solver," tell the story of the time you fixed a broken process that was costing time and money.</p>
        <p>Event planners don't say they're "detail oriented." They mention the 500-person conference they ran without a hitch. Writers don't claim they're "creative." They link to published work. Stories beat labels every time. Give examples or skip the claim entirely.</p>

        <h2>Use a Personal LinkedIn URL</h2>
        <p>Change your messy default URL to something clean. It takes two minutes.</p>
        <p>Go to settings and customize your LinkedIn URL. Use your actual name. If someone already took it, add your middle initial or what you do. linkedin.com/in/yourname beats linkedin.com/in/rocco-russo-4b7a89234 every time.</p>
        <p>You'll use this URL everywhere. Email signatures, business cards, job applications, casual introductions. A clean URL makes you look organized before anyone reads a word. Small fix, big impression.</p>

        <h2>Post About Small Wins Publicly</h2>
        <p>Got a PR merged? Fixed a nasty bug? Got shortlisted for an interview? Share it.</p>
        <p>Small wins aren't bragging. They're proof you're actively working and growing. A physical therapist celebrates when a patient hits a recovery milestone. A mechanic posts about solving a tricky engine problem. You should do the same.</p>
        <p>Visibility matters more than perfection. Sharing progress builds credibility and keeps you top of mind. Your network can't cheer for wins they never see. Post the small stuff. It adds up.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <h2>Comment Like You Mean It</h2>
        <p>"Great post!" is the LinkedIn version of a limp handshake. Add substance or don't comment.</p>
        <p>Say something real. Ask a follow-up question. Share a related experience. Disagree politely if you have a different view. Real comments start conversations. Generic ones just take up space.</p>
        <p>Think of it this way: if you wouldn't say it face to face, don't type it. Teachers who comment on education posts with actual classroom stories get noticed. Engineers who add technical nuance to architecture discussions get remembered. Depth beats volume every time.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <h2>Don't Ghost Your Profile</h2>
        <p>Show up at least once a week. Like something, comment somewhere, post when you have something worth saying.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn rewards consistency, not bursts of activity followed by silence. If you disappear for months, you're starting from zero every time you come back. Nurses post about patient care regularly. Designers share work in progress weekly. Pick a rhythm and stick to it.</p>
        <p>You don't need to post daily. You just need to exist. Being present beats being perfect. Set a reminder if you need one.</p>

        <h2>Connect With Recruiters (But Do It Right)</h2>
        <p>Don't send "Hi, give me a job" messages. That's noise, not networking.</p>
        <p>When you connect with a recruiter, mention something specific. "Saw your post about remote roles in fintech. My background in payment systems might align. Would love to connect." That's context, not begging.</p>
        <p>Recruiters talk to hundreds of people. Make it easy for them to remember you. Chefs don't walk into restaurants demanding jobs. They talk about their experience and what they bring. Same logic applies here. Give them a reason to say yes.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <h2>Repost With Your Own Take</h2>
        <p>Sharing someone else's post? Add your thoughts above it. Don't just hit the repost button.</p>
        <p>A bare repost says nothing about you. Adding commentary shows you actually read it and thought about it. Agree? Say why. Disagree? Explain your angle. Saw something they missed? Point it out.</p>
        <p>Tag the original author. They'll often engage with your addition, which puts your comment in front of their network too. Journalists do this with op-eds. Analysts do it with research papers. It's called building on ideas, not just passing them along.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <h2>Use Emojis (Just a Few)</h2>
        <p>A couple of emojis make your posts easier to scan. Too many make you look unhinged.</p>
        <p>Drop an emoji or two to break up text or highlight key points. They work like visual punctuation. But if your post looks like a kindergarten bulletin board, you've gone too far. Three max per post is a good rule.</p>
        <p>Marketing folks use them. HR people use them. Even CFOs sneak in a chart emoji occasionally. Just match your industry's comfort level. When in doubt, use fewer.</p>

        <h2>Support Other Juniors Publicly</h2>
        <p>Your peers today are your referrals tomorrow. Celebrate their wins like you'd want them to celebrate yours.</p>
        <p>Someone in your network lands a new role? Congratulate them publicly. A bootcamp classmate ships their first project? Comment on it. Junior developers help each other. So do junior accountants, designers, and project managers.</p>
        <p>Building these connections now pays off later when you're both looking to hire or get hired. Plus, it just makes the whole experience less lonely. Career growth isn't a solo sport.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <h2>Make Your Profile Mobile-Friendly</h2>
        <p>Most people check LinkedIn on their phones. If your profile looks messy on mobile, you're losing chances.</p>
        <p>Keep paragraphs short. Use line breaks. Avoid walls of text. Open LinkedIn on your phone and look at your own profile. If you wouldn't read it, neither will anyone else.</p>
        <p>Recruiters scroll fast. Hiring managers check profiles between meetings. If your About section is one giant paragraph, they'll skip it. White space isn't wasted space. It's readability.</p>

        <h2>Set Weekly Posting Goals (Small Ones)</h2>
        <p>Posting once a week is enough. Don't burn out trying to post daily.</p>
        <p>Pick one day. Write something useful. Hit publish. That's it. Consistency beats frequency every time. One thoughtful post per week builds more trust than five rushed ones.</p>
        <p>Content creators know this. Podcasters release episodes on schedule. Newsletter writers stick to their cadence. You're not trying to go viral. You're trying to stay visible to the people who matter. Weekly works just fine.</p>
