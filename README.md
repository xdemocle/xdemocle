### Hello, visitor! ðŸ‘‹

**Rocco's GitHub  profile**

I'm a seasoned software engineer with two decades of experience. As a Lead Full-Stack Engineer, I define the direction for blockchain and Web3. From South Italy to the globe, I assist in developing decentralized applications (DApps) that redefine user experiences: tokenized assets, DeFi platforms, and smart contract integrations. My recent projects have delivered millions in liquidity, a 20% boost in user engagement, and peak concurrency milestones, including 5M+ visitors on initiatives like SHIBA INU.

My Toolkit:
- *Full-Stack Mastery*: React, React Native, Svelte, TypeScript, Next.js, Remix, GraphQL, Node.js, Web3.js, PHP, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Apollo, Gatsby.js 
- *Blockchain Expertise*: Ethereum, Solana, EVM compatibles, token creation, Smart Contracts (Solidity), Solana Programs 
- *DevOps & Cloud*: AWS (EC2, S3, CDN), GCP, Docker, CI/CD, GIT (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) 
- *Databases*: SQL, NoSQL, Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis 
- *Soft Skills*: Leadership, Mentorship, Teamwork, Communication, Decision-Making, Resilience 

I thrive at the intersection of code and impact, mentoring teams to success, boosting code quality, and slashing tech debt. Based in Italy, but I work also through my LLC in the USA (no W2, yes C2C), and together with my self-employed Italian company. Iâ€™m available for contracts in Italy, Europe/EMEA, Dubai/UAE, and beyond.

P.S. Scammers, stay away. I'm broke, and I will make you cry anyway.
