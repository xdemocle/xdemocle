### Hi 👋

I’m a seasoned software engineer with two decades of experience. As a Lead Full-Stack Engineer, I drive the future of blockchain and Web3. From South Italy to the global stage, I specialize in crafting decentralized applications (DApps) that transform user experiences: think tokenized assets, DeFi platforms, and smart contract integrations. My recent projects have delivered millions in liquidity, a 20% boost in user engagement, and peak concurrency milestones, including 5M+ visitors on initiatives like SHIBA INU. 

My Toolkit:
- *Full-Stack Mastery*: React, React Native, Svelte, TypeScript, Next.js, Remix, GraphQL, Node.js, Web3.js, PHP, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Apollo, Gatsby.js 
- *Blockchain Expertise*: Ethereum, Solana, EVM compatibles, token creation, Smart Contracts (Solidity), Solana Programs 
- *DevOps & Cloud*: AWS (EC2, S3, CDN), GCP, Docker, CI/CD, GIT (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) 
- *Databases*: SQL, NoSQL, Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis 
- *Soft Skills*: Leadership, Mentorship, Teamwork, Communication, Decision-Making, Resilience 

I thrive at the intersection of code and impact, mentoring teams to success, boosting code quality, and slashing tech debt. Based in the USA (no W2, yes C2C), I’m available for contracts in Italy, Europe/EMEA, Dubai/UAE, and beyond. Let’s build something groundbreaking together!
