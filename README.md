### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end engineer and tech lead with over 10 years of experience in delivering web solutions for various industries and domains. I have a passion for web3 and blockchain technologies, and I have successfully integrated them into several projects as a lead front-end web3 engineer. I am currently working as a technical team lead at SHIBA INU OFFICIAL, a leading decentralized platform for social media and commerce.

As a tech lead, I oversee the technical aspects of front-end development, provide guidance and support to a team of engineers, and actively contribute to coding projects. I also drive innovation and deliver high-quality front-end solutions that meet the needs and expectations of SHIBA INU and its users. Some of my key skills include React, TypeScript, Web3.js, GraphQL, Tailwind CSS, and Crypto Wallets. I am always eager to learn new technologies and methods, and to collaborate with remote and local teams around the world. My goal is to create customer-centric solutions that help businesses reach their goals and empower users with web3 and blockchain.
